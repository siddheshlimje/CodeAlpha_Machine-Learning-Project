🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Scikit-learn
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic Machine Learning classification task using the famous Iris dataset.
The objective is to build a model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

based on their physical measurements.

This project marks the beginning of my Machine Learning journey and focuses on understanding core classification concepts.

📊 Dataset Information

The dataset contains 150 samples with the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

Target variable:

Flower species (3 classes)

The dataset is loaded directly from Scikit-learn.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib (if used)

🚀 Steps Performed

Loaded dataset using Scikit-learn

Performed train-test split (80% training, 20% testing)

Trained a Logistic Regression model

Evaluated model performance using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Classification Report

📈 Model Performance

The model achieved approximately 97–100% accuracy on the test dataset.

This indicates that the model can effectively classify Iris flower species based on the given features.
